# What is this?
This is an exercise and a portfolio piece. I am using it to understand how to use a state machine pattern in an interesting way. While practicing my art and animation in a productive way.

This is not a 'full game' but more of a tech demo and learning experience for myself. 

The 'game' consists of a single room sporting a few platforms, and the player character.

**Moving** and **Jumping** is all you'll be able to do.
